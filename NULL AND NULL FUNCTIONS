1) What NULL really means?
         = We might think NULL =0 OR NULL= False but NULL actually means Unknown, not available, not applicable .It means we don't know the value. 

For example: 
Name: Ram
Age: ?
Phone number: not provided

= Age and Phone number is NULL since we don't know its value. 

Syntax: Two NULL check operators
1) IS NULL
2) IS NOT NULL . Never use = , != etc.
